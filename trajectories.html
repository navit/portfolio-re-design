        <h1>TRAJECTORIES OF GROWTH</h1>
         <h2>Politcs and Petri Dishes</h2> 
        <p>
        In this project I am challenging the way we read information from maps, experimenting with the possibilities maps have beyond what is obvious and visible. The project deals with the ungovernable growth of living systems both from a geographical and biological perspective. My process was manipulating the area of the West Bank by isolating the Jewish Settlements in it and composing them together to create a new 3d object. The object was placed into petri dishes with bacteria samples. Simply put, there were two ecosystems living in the dishes, a biological one and a human/political one. I compared and monitored the growth of those two.
